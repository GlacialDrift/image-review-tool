"""Database initialization and ingestion for the Image Review Tool.

This script scans the configured image root, filters filenames by a strict
pattern, inserts image metadata into the database, and seeds the review queue.
Approximately a configurable fraction of images are flagged as QC (duplicate
review) and receive a second review row to enable inter-rater consistency checks.

Usage:
    python -m init_db
or:
    python init_db.py

Behavior:
  * Reads paths and parameters from `config.ini` via `app.config.load_config()`.
  * Ensures the schema exists and applies any migrations.
  * Walks all subfolders under `IMAGE_ROOT`.
  * Accepts only *.jpg / *.jpeg files whose names match `(\\d{11})_(000|001).jpg`.
  * Inserts each unique image into `images` with a SHA-256 digest.
  * Logs the device_id suffix (e.g. '000' or '001') as the variant
  * Flags ~QC_RATE of images as QC duplicates and seeds two review rows.
  * Seeds exactly one review row for non-QC images.
  * Re-running is idempotent: existing images/reviews are not duplicated.

Design notes:
  * The SHA-256 is used for integrity/duplicate detection and auditing.
  * The filename regex extracts an 11-digit device_id for later reporting.
  * All timestamps are UTC (`datetime('now')` in SQLite).

    Steps:
      1) Load configuration (paths, QC rate, random seed).
      2) Connect to SQLite, ensure schema, and run migrations.
      3) Recursively walk the image root and filter acceptable files.
      4) For each matching file:
         - Insert into `images` if not present (path, device_id, variant, sha256, timestamp).
         - Randomly flag as QC with probability QC_RATE.
         - Seed one `reviews` row (status='unassigned').
         - If QC, seed a second independent `reviews` row (still 'unassigned'),
           but guard against >2 rows on re-runs.

    Logging:
      Prints counts of added and skipped files for quick operator feedback.

    Idempotency:
      Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` and a defensive LIMIT to prevent duplication if
      re-run against the same dataset.

    Raises:

      OSError: If files cannot be read for hashing.
